Beginner-Friendly Definition of Regular Expression (Regex):

A regular expression (regex) is a pattern or rule that helps you search, match, or validate text. Think of it like a "template" for finding specific words, numbers, or patterns in a block of text.

For example:
- You want to check if a text looks like an email.
- You want to find all phone numbers in a document.
- You want to check if a password meets certain rules, like containing numbers and letters.

A regex is simply a set of rules written in a special way that lets you do these tasks quickly.

Example of Regex in Plain English:
Imagine you have a rule: 
- "Find any word that starts with a capital letter."

In regex, this rule looks like:
[A-Z][a-z]+

A Basic Example in Code:
Task: Check if a string contains only digits.

Here’s how it works:

```javascript
const regex = /^\d+$/;

const validInput = "12345";
const invalidInput = "123a45";

console.log(regex.test(validInput)); // Output: true (It's all numbers)
console.log(regex.test(invalidInput)); // Output: false (It has letters)
```

Explanation:
- `^`: The start of the text.
- `\d`: Matches any single digit (0–9).
- `+`: Matches one or more of the preceding character (digits in this case).
- `$`: The end of the text.

This regex ensures the entire input is only digits.
