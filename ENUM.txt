ENUM :-
	An enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type used to define a set of named constant values. It’s often used when you have a fixed set of related options or categories, making your code more readable and organized.

	Let’s break it down simply:

Why use enums?
	They help you avoid using arbitrary numbers or strings in your code, giving clear names to specific values.

How does it work?
	Each value in an enum has a name and a corresponding value (usually integers starting from 0, but you can customize this).


In Python:

from enum import Enum

class Day(Enum):
    SUNDAY = 1
    MONDAY = 2
    TUESDAY = 3
    WEDNESDAY = 4
    THURSDAY = 5
    FRIDAY = 6
    SATURDAY = 7

print(Day.SUNDAY)       # Day.SUNDAY
print(Day.SUNDAY.name)  # SUNDAY
print(Day.SUNDAY.value) # 1
