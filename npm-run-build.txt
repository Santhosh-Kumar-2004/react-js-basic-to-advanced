In React.js, the command:
npm run build


does the following:

ðŸŒŸ What it does:
It creates an optimized production build of your React app.
The output is placed in the build/ folder.
All JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and static assets (like images) are minified and bundled for better performance.
React uses webpack and Babel under the hood to do this.
ðŸš€ Why it's used:
Deployment: The build/ folder contains everything needed to deploy your app to a web server or hosting platform (like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).
Optimization: It ensures your app runs faster by minimizing file sizes and optimizing asset loading.
Static site: The output is just static files (HTML, CSS, JS), meaning you don't need a Node.js server to run it â€” a simple web server can host it.
